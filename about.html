<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
<p>My name is Alessio Chiapperini, on the Internet you can find me under the alias spidernet or some clever variation of it (I like to use spookernet in October).</p>
<p>I have a master degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.uniud.it/en">Università degli studi di Udine</a> which focused on automatic and formal
verification of software, programming languages and distributed systems; my master thesis was on bigraphical reactive systems and its purpose was to define the
embedding problem for directed bigraphs, then I translated the problem into a constraint satisfaction problem, whose solutions agree with the solutions of the
embedding problem. I then gave an implementation of the proposed algorithm as well as an implementation of directed bigraphical reactive systems and finally
conducted some experimental tests to evaluate the performance of the implementation in different scenarios. An article regarding the work done on my thesis is
available <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-51372-6_3">here</a>.</p>
<p>In my day job I am testing engineer for a wireless semiconductors and modules vendor, which involves testing various aspects of cellular networks, MNO
(Mobile Network Operator) and testing communications protocols (FTP, MQTT, etc.) both in a real and simulated scenarios. I also help maintaining the automated
test suite written in Perl.</a>
<p>My interests ranges from low-level programming and embedded systems to formal verification, (mathematical) logic, distributed systems, compilers and
information theory.</p>

<p>This blog is mainly about what I do outside my studies or job. Here I mainly write about topics that I find interesting, things I’ve recently learned or cool
ideas.</p>

<h2 id="software">Software preferences</h2>
<p>As far as operating systems goes, I have been a GNU/Linux user since 2009. Recently, I switched to FreeBSD but from time to time I like to use various BSDs or
other linux distros. I like small and very simple tools without frills and distractions.</p>
<p>Most of my work is done in Vim and tmux. I have been using tiling window managers for years but since I usually use one or at most two monitor with the same
"basic" tiling layouts, I've switched to the simpler <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/cwm.1">cwm(1)</a>.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">pass</a> for managing my passwords. It’s simple, it follows the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">Unix philosophy</a> and it even lets me track changes using git so I can access them from any device;
yes even my phone.</p>
<p>For content consumption I use <a href="https://mpv.io/">mpv</a> with <a href="https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/">youtube-dl</a> and
<a href="https://www.smplayer.info/">smplayer</a>; my music player of choice is <a href="https://cmus.github.io/">cmus</a>.</p>
<p>For emails I use aerc, an email client written in go that aims to be efficient and extensible. Note that it is still a work in progress, so if you do decide
to try it, expect some bugs.</p>
<p>My dotfiles can be found <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~spidernet/dotfiles">here</a>, they’re mostly stable except my vimrc, I’m addicted to tweaking it.</p>
<p>My favourite programming language is C, it’s very fast, it has a very simple syntax and it’s not a big language, hence you can actually master it, albeit
with some effort and not without turning up your nose in a couple of places (ok more than a couple). However, if you get around its quirks, it’s a really good
language and it will teach you a lot. I fell in love with its simplicity and power, it’s so poweful that it can even format your harddrive if you’re not careful.
Gotta love <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/programming/rust/2018/08/17/undefined-behavior.html">undefined behavior</a>. C is usually my <code>goto</code>
language unless a particular language is better suited for that domain.</p>
<p>Another language that I like is Haskell. Functional programming has a place in my heart (the first programming course in university was about
<a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a>, a language based on the Scheme dialect of Lisp). Learning and using functional languages really opened my mind
and in the meantime probably messed it up too :D.  If with C it was love at first sight, with Haskell it’s more of a love-hate relationship.</p>
