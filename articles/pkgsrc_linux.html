<p>As you probabily know I’m in the process of writing my master thesis in CS on <em>bigraphical reactive systems</em>. To do this I’ll contribute to, and extend
an existing library written in Java, so I needed to setup a development environment.</p>
<p>My goal was to have an isolated environment with its own set of packages and libraries that I could easily manage (add new packages, remove them and update
them) without polluting my "local" environment. There are various ways to achieve this, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>by using a <b>virtual machine</b> with the proper packages installed. This solution provides an isolated environment, but it does so at the expense of system
resources, be it RAM, disk space or CPU. Granted that for my needs it wouldn’t have been a big problem since I could have used a minimal Ubuntu or Debian image,
but that’s still an OS worth of disk space on top of the tools and libraries I needed;</li>
<li>using a containerized environment (<b>Docker</b>, <b>Kubernetes</b>, …) provides all benefits of using a virtual machine and more, all while taking up less
space and being more modular. I already use containers, for example I have one container for building LaTeX sources. All in all this is a solid choice;</li>
<li><b>nix</b> and <b>nix-shell</b>: the nix package manager (and NixOS as a whole) provides a way to define virtual environments using the <code>nix-shell</code>
command. You can build different environments for different projects and with different version of packages all of them isolated from each other. You can read
more about it <a href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Development_environment_with_nix-shell">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Out of these three ways I’d have chosen to use the nix package manager and nix-shell as it is the most flexible of the them. But that’s not what I’m going to
talk about, instead I decided to use <a href="https://www.pkgsrc.org/">pkgsrc</a>, NetBSD’s package manager. It offers more than 22.000 packages available for
23 different platforms.</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup pkgsrc</h2>
<p>Before using pksrc the <a href="https://wiki.netbsd.org/pkgsrc/how_to_use_pkgsrc_on_linux/">wiki</a> reccomends having the following packages installed:
gcc (and libstdc++), libncurses-devel, zlib and zlib-devel. You can install pkgsrc using your distribution package manager, for example for Arch Linux you can
find it in the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/netbsd-pkgsrc/">AUR</a>, which at the moment of writing this article is based on the version of
packages of Q3 2019. Otherwise you can install it by downloading it from git, for example:</p>
<pre><code>git clone --depth 1 -b pkgsrc-2019Q3 https://github.com/netbsd/pkgsrc ~/pkgsrc</code></pre>
<p>or
<pre><code>git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/netbsd/pkgsrc ~/pkgsrc</code></pre>
for the latest version.</p>
<p>Once you’ve installed and downloaded pksrc you have to <em>bootstrap</em> it. It can be bootstrapped in two modes: privileged and unprivileged. In unprivileged
mode packages are installed for one single user. By default it’d be bootstrapped in privileged moded. Boostraping it is as simple as:</p>
<pre><code class="command">$ cd /path/to/pkgsrc/bootstrap
# ./bootstrap</code></pre>
<p>To bootrstrap it in unprivileged mode you can pass it the <code>--unprivileged</code> option. By default, in privileged mode pksrc will use <code>/usr/pkg</code>
for prefix where programs will be installed, while in unprivileged mode <code>~/pkg</code> will be used. To manually change the prefix you can use the
<code>--prefix</code> option. It is thus possibile to bootstrap multiple instances of pkgsrc in different directories and have different development
environments.</p>
<p>After having bootstrapped pkgsrc we can set the <code>PATH</code> and <code>MANPATH</code> accordingly:</p>
<pre><code class="command">$ PATH=/usr/pkg/sbin:/usr/pkg/bin:$PATH
$ MANPATH=/usr/pkg/man:$MANPATH</code></pre>
<p>If we have multiple instances of pkgsrc we have to be extra careful about setting the <code>PATH</code> variable. For example if we have two instances of pkgsrc,
one for Java development and one for C development in folders <code>~/javaenv</code> and <code>~/cenv</code>, by using some bash magic we can define two functions
to set the <code>PATH</code> variable whenever we want to use the binaries in the Java environment or in the C environment, or even change the path depending on
the current working directory (see <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/914087/can-i-change-my-path-dynamically-based-on-my-cwd">here</a>).</p>

<h2 id="manage_pkgs">Manage packages</h2>
<p>Pkgsrc provides a series of utilities to help you manage your packages:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pkg_info</code> lets you query information about installed packages. For example <code>pkg_info -u</code> lists all user-installed packages and not
their dependencies, while <code>pkg_info -a</code> shows all installed packages, for more info read <code>man pkg_info</code>;</li>
<li><code>pkg_admin</code> lets you perform various administration tasks on your packages, like check the MD5 checksum of installed packages, check
vulnerabilities of installe packages and other tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>The other utilities will be discussed in the following sections.</p>

<h3 id="install_pkgs">Install packages</h3>
<p>There are two ways to install packages: you can either build it from source or install a precompiled binary.</p>

<h4>Build packages</h4>
<p>To build a package from sources you first need to locate it under <code>${PREFIX}/pkgsrc</code>, for example to search <code>clang</code> you could do</p>
<pre><code class="command">$ find /usr/pkgsrc -type d -name "clang"</code>
<code>/usr/pkgsrc/lang/clang</code></pre>
<p>Now to build it you would <code>cd</code> into <code>/usr/pkgsrc/lang/clang</code> and then you can compile and install it:</p>
<pre><code class="command">$ sudo bmake install</code></pre>
<p>this would also build its dependencies. If you want to clean the object files generates during the build process you could append <code>clean</code> to the
build command:</p>
<pre><code class="command">sudo bmake install clean</code></pre>
<p>If you’re building a package for several systems you can create a package and install it afterwards:</p>
<pre><code class="command">$ sudo bmake package</code>
<code>[...]
=> Creating binary package in /usr/pkgsrc/packages/All/clang-X.Y.Z.tgz
</code>
<code class="command">$ sudo pkg_add /usr/pkgsrc/packages/All/clang-X.Y.Z.tgz</code></pre>

<h4>Install binaries</h4>
<p>In order to install precompiled binaries we need to use <a href="http://pkgin.net/">pkgin</a>, we can install it by building it from source by calling
<pre><code>sudo bmake install clean</code></pre> from <code>${PREFIX}/usr/pkgsrc/pkgtools/pkgin</code>.</p>
<p>Before using pkgin we need to setup a repository in the <code>${PREFIX}/etc/pkgin/repositories.conf</code> file, we will use the binary packages
provided by <a href="https://pkgsrc.joyent.com/">joyent</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="command">$ echo https://pkgsrc.joyent.com/packages/Linux/el7/trunk/x86_64/All/ > /usr/pkg/etc/pkgin/repositories.conf</code></pre>
<p>After this you can use 
<pre><code class="command"># pkgin update</code></pre>
to build the initial database and to keep it synchronized. Now you’re ready to use pkgin, for example to install tmux run:
<pre><code class="command"># pkgin install tmux</code></pre></p>
<p>To learn about the other commands you can refer its manual or to <a href="http://pkgin.net/">this page</a>.</p>

<h3 id="rm_pkgs">Remove packages</h3>
<p>Removing a package, whether it was installed from source code or from a binary package is as simple as calling</p>
<pre><code class="command">$ sudo pkg_delete pkg_name</code></pre>
<p>it can also accept wildcards, for example
<pre><code class="command"># pkg_delete "*emacs*"</code></pre>
removes the set of emacs packages.</p>

<h3 id="upd_pkgs">Update packages</h3>
<p>There are <a href="https://wiki.netbsd.org/pkgsrc/how_to_upgrade_packages/">various ways</a> to update packages in pkgsrc. For updating binaries I use:</p>
<pre><code class="command">$ pkgin update
$ pkgin full-upgrade</code></pre>
<p>For packages built from source I use <code>pkg_rolling-replace</code> a shell script available in
<a href="http://pkgsrc.se/pkgtools/pkg_rolling-replace">pkgtools/pkg_rolling-replace</a>. For more info check its man page or
<a href="https://wiki.netbsd.org/pkgsrc/how_to_upgrade_packages/">this page</a> in pkgsrc’s wiki.
<p class="info info-blue" style="font-size:initial;"><b>NOTE:</b><br>
Before updating packages make sure to download an updated pkgsrc directory.</p>

<h2 id="pros_cons">Pros and Cons</h2>
<p>We’ve seen how to setup pkgsrc, how to install packages and how it could be used as a development environment and with some effort we can have multiple
environments. But there are some disadvantages to consider: first of all, not every package is available as a binary (for Linux) so we might have to compile it
from source, second is that as far as I am aware you cannot directly install a specific version of a package that is not in the repository. Moreover, as we’ve
seen, setting up multiple development environments is a bit involved and requires to mess with environment variables, so it’s not really user friendly. All these
disadvantages come from the fact that pkgsrc’s goal is to be a package management system and not to provide a development environment.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusions</h2>
<p>In conclusion it’s indeed possible to use pkgsrc as a development environments but it is a quite exotic setup and it has some shortcomings, therefore it might
not be for everyone or even suitable especially in production.</p>
