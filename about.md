My name is Alessio Chiapperini, on the Internet you can find me under the alias *spidernet* or some clever variation of 
it (I like to use *spookernet* in October).
I have a master degree in Computer Science from [Universit√† degli studi di Udine](https://www.uniud.it/en) which
focused on automatic and formal verification of software, programming languages and distributed systems; my master
thesis was on *bigraphical reactive systems* and its purpose was to define *the embedding problem* for directed
bigraphs, then I translated the problem into a *constraint satisfaction problem*, whose solutions agree with the
solutions of the embedding problem. I then gave an implementation of the proposed algorithm as well as an
implementation of *directed bigraphical reactive systems* and finally conducted some experimental tests to evaluate the
performance of the implementation in different scenarios. An article regarding the work done on my thesis is available
at [here](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-51372-6_3).
In my day job I am testing engineer for a wireless semiconductors and modules vendor, which involves testing various
aspects of cellular networks, MNO (Mobile Network Operator) and testing communications protocols (FTP, MQTT, etc.) both
in a real and simulated scenarios. I also help maintaining the automated test suite written in Perl.

My interests ranges from low-level programming and embedded systems to formal verification, (mathematical) logic,
distributed systems, compilers and information theory.

This blog is mainly about what I do outside my studies or job. Here I mainly write about topics that I find interesting,
things I've recently learned or cool ideas.

Also keep in mind that english is not my native language.

## Software preferences
As far as operating systems goes, I have been a GNU/Linux user since 2009. I mainly use ArchLinux, but from time to
time I like to use various BSDs or other linux distros. I like small and very simple tools without frills and
distractions.

Most of my work is done in Vim and tmux. I have been using [spectrwm](https://github.com/conformal/spectrwm) as a window
manager for about a year, before that I was using [xmonad](https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad). I really like the
flexibility of a tiling window manager.

I use [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) for managing my passwords. It's simple, it follows the [Unix
philosophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) and it even lets me track changes using git so I can access
them from any device; yes even my phone.

For content consumption I use [mpv](https://mpv.io/) with [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/) and 
[smplayer](https://www.smplayer.info/); my music player of choice is [cmus](https://cmus.github.io/).

For emails I use [aerc](https://aerc-mail.org/), an email client written in go that aims to be efficient and
extensible. Note that it is still a work in progress, so if you do decide to try it, expect some bugs.

My dotfiles can be found [here](https://git.sr.ht/~spidernet/dotfiles), they're mostly stable except my vimrc, I'm
addicted to tweaking it.

My favourite programming language is C, it's very fast, it has a very simple syntax and it's not a big language, hence
you can actually master it, albeit with some effort and not without turning up your nose in a couple of places (ok more
than a couple). However, if you get around its quirks, it's a really good language and it will teach you a lot. I fell
in love with its  simplicity and power, it's so poweful that  it can even format your harddrive if you're not careful. 
Gotta love [undefined behavior](https://raphlinus.github.io/programming/rust/2018/08/17/undefined-behavior.html). C is 
usually my `goto` language unless a particular language is better suited for that domain. 

Another language that I like is Haskell. Functional programming has a place in my heart (the first programming course in 
university was about [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/), a language based on the Scheme dialect of Lisp). Learning and 
using functional languages really opened my mind and in the meantime probably messed it up too :D. If with C it was love
at first sight, with Haskell it's more of a love-hate relationship.

## Contact
My email should be available at the bottom of the page, at least that's where it should be. So much for responsive
design ;-). Feel free to send me an email.
